# Notes

A prosperous unification start gives you 32 pops. Back in the olden days, when 1 pop = 1 billion people made sense, the same start gave you 10 starting pops. This means that 1 pop ~ 300 million people.

Hence consequently, world population in the year 2000 is 6 billion, or 20 pops.

Sorting these into three buckets of income as of the year 2000, which I guess correspond to strata in this mod:

- 2.32 Bn below $1000/yr (8 pops)
- 5.41 Bn below $10000/yr (10 pops)
- 6.11 Bn below $100000/yr (2 pops)

For the sake of divisibility I might make these 9/9/3 for a total population of 21 pops.
