# Notes

## Initial Pop Numbers

A prosperous unification start gives you 32 pops. Back in the olden days, when 1 pop = 1 billion people made sense, the same start gave you 10 starting pops. This means that 1 pop ~ 300 million people.

Hence consequently, world population in the year 2000 is 6 billion, or 20 pops.

Sorting these into three buckets of income as of the year 2000, which I guess correspond to strata in this mod:
- 2.32 Bn below $1000/yr (8 pops)
- 5.41 Bn below $10000/yr (10 pops)
- 6.11 Bn below $100000/yr (2 pops)

For the sake of divisibility I might make these 9/9/3 for a total population of 21 pops.

## Origins
(Which of these are Origins, as opposed to traits, or civics? )
- **United Nations** - The standard origin, a supranational organisation that symbolically metaphorically represents the spirit of the civilisation or some such nonsense. Not entirely clear on how this precisely shakes out.
